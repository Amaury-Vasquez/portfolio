            <br />
            I am currently pursuing my third year bachelor degree in computer
            systems, at ESCOM IPN, while also working at different personal
            projects in order to increase mi technical skills. <br />
            <br />
            Coding is my passion, I really enjoy creating stuff and learning new
            skills everyday. I'm also currently studying at Platzi in my free
            time. <br /> <br />I strongly believe that happiness in life comes
            from becoming better than the one you were the day before. And
            everyday I try my best to remain happy.
